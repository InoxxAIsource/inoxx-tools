Creating a complete, standalone Python script for an entire modern eCommerce website with all the specified features is beyond the scope of a single Python script, especially considering the complexity and the need for multiple technologies and frameworks like React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Django, and various APIs. However, I can provide you with a basic Python script that demonstrates a simple eCommerce-like functionality using the standard library. This script will focus on a basic product listing and a simple shopping cart system.

```python
# Simple eCommerce-like script with product listings and a shopping cart
# Required imports
import json

def main_function():
    """Simulate a simple eCommerce system with product listings and a shopping cart."""
    # Sample product data
    products = [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 999.99},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 499.99},
        {"id": 3, "name": "Headphones", "price": 199.99}
    ]

    # Display product listings
    print("Available Products:")
    for product in products:
        print(f"ID: {product['id']}, Name: {product['name']}, Price: ${product['price']}")

    # Simulate adding products to a shopping cart
    cart = []
    cart.append(products[0])  # Add Laptop to cart
    cart.append(products[2])  # Add Headphones to cart

    # Calculate total price
    total_price = sum(item['price'] for item in cart)

    # Display cart contents and total price
    print("\nShopping Cart:")
    for item in cart:
        print(f"Name: {item['name']}, Price: ${item['price']}")
    print(f"Total Price: ${total_price}")

    return total_price

# Additional functions/classes if needed
def helper_function():
    """A placeholder for additional functionality."""
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage with sample inputs
    result = main_function()
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Product Listings**: The script defines a list of products, each with an ID, name, and price.
- **Shopping Cart**: Simulates adding products to a cart and calculates the total price.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how the script can be used to display products and simulate a shopping cart.

This script is a very simplified version of an eCommerce system and does not include advanced features like user authentication, secure checkout, or AI-driven functionalities. Implementing a full-fledged eCommerce platform would require a comprehensive approach involving multiple technologies and frameworks
